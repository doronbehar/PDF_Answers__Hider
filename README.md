# PDF_Answers__Hider
When your PDF past exams has the answers marked and highlighted - this tool removes it

Instructions:
1. download the .py file and run it on your python interperter OR just download the EXE file which made of the same script.
if your windows warn you about it, click "more info" and then allow it to run.
2. choose a pdf file with answers marked on it, then choose where to locate the "clean" pdf and let it run.

NOTES:
1. Adobe Reader doesn't like some files, I am not sure why. If it happens to you - try to open the clean file using Chrome, FireFox, Foxit etc.
2. It isn't an AI, ML, CV fancy script, it basically removes a layer of the pdf of shapes, leaving the text as it is.
If there are other images, sketches or some other objects on this layer- they might be removed as well, take it into considerations.

Have some background with PyPDF2? 
Have some idea for how to make this app better? contact me, or even better- take my code and improve it!

If you know how to fix the windows warning or the Adobe in-compatibility - LMK.
